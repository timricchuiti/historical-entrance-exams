  \item Reduce to their lowest terms as vulgar fractions the infinite or circulating decimals $0.\dot{2}2\dot5$, $0.00\dot{2}2\dot5$, $0.25\dot{2}2\dot5$. Reduce $\frac{3}{7}$ to a circulating decimal.\endnote{The dot notation is archaic. Modern notation would use an overbar. The decimals in the document would now be written as $0.\overline{225}, 0.00\overline{225}$, and $0.25\overline{225}.$} \vfill

    \item Find by logarithms, using arithmetical complements, the value of the fraction\endnote{It's unclear whether the square root in the denominator was intended for the whole product or only the 0.0046. However, the use of parentheses around 0.0046 suggests the square root was only meant to be computed on that portion. In modern type-setting, that would be $\sqrt{0.0046} \times 23.309$}
    \[
    \frac{(0.02183)^2 \times (7)^{\frac23}}{\surd(0.0046) \times 23.309}

    \vfill

    \item Prove the formula for the \textit{cosine of the sum of two angles;} and deduce the formulas for the cosine of the \textit{double} of an angle and the cosine of the \textit{half} of an angle. \vfill

    \item In what quadrants is the cosine \textit{positive}, and in what quadrants \textit{negative?} Prove the values of the cosine of $0^\circ, 90^\circ, 180^\circ, 270^\circ$. \vfill

    \item Given in an oblique triangle $b=0.254$, $c=0.317$, $B=46^\circ$. Solve completely. \vfill
